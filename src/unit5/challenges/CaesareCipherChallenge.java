/*
The Caesar Cipher, used by Julius Caesar around 58 BC, is a substitution cipher that shifts letters in a message to make
it unreadable if intercepted. To decrypt, the receiver reverses the shift. Arab mathematician Al-Kindi broke the Caesar
Cipher using frequency analysis, which exploits patterns in letter frequencies.

Challenge:
First:
Write an encode method which takes a string and an offset and returns an encrypted string

Second:
Write a decode method which takes an encoded string and an offset and returns the original message.
