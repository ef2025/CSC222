Assume the radius of the circle is 1. Therefore, the circle area is pi and the square area is 4. Randomly generate a
point in the square. The probability for the point to fall in the circle is circleArea / squareArea = pi / 4.

Write a program that randomly generates 1,000,000 points in the square and let numberOfHits denote the
number of points that fall in the circle. Thus, numberOfHits is approximately 1000000 * (pi / 4). Therefor, pi can be
approximated as 4 * numberOfHits / 1000000.

Write the complete program for estimating pi.

Hint:
import java.util.Random;
Random rand = new Random();
double num = rand.nextDouble();
